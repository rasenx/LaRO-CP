LaRO CP is a control panel made using Laravel for Hercules and rAthena emulators. The name is the combination of Laravel and Ragnarok Online, but at the same time it could be interpreted as a Filipino word for ‘game’. Its mission is to have all the features of the current FluxCP at the very least on release.

Support will first begin with Hercules and then rAthena.
